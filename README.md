# Music player interface coded in vanilla JS.  
## Play - Pause - Next Song - Prev Song - Click to Skip.  

# What I used
> DOM manipulation  
> template literals to make it dynamic  
> separation of concerns (SoC) in the architecture     
> commenting throughout       
> naming conventions for booleans (i.e. isPlaying)     
> indexing to keep track in array looping
